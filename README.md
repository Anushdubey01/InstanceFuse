MASK R-CNN: A UNIFIED FRAMEWORK FOR OBJECT INSTANCE SEGMENTATION AND BEYOND

## Mask R-CNN: Balloon Detection in COCO

**This repo tackles object instance segmentation, specifically training Mask R-CNN to detect and segment balloons in the COCO dataset.**

**Highlights:**

* Fine-tuned Mask R-CNN for accurate balloon detection.
* Leverages pre-trained model for efficient learning.
* Optimized hyperparameters for balloon task.
* Evaluated with metrics like AP and MSE.
* Visualizations showcase generalization to unseen images.

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone & install dependencies.
2. Train & evaluate model (`train.py`, `evaluate.py`).
3. Visualize results (`visualization.py`).

**Dataset & Pre-trained Model:**

* COCO dataset for training/validation.
* "COCO-InstanceSegmentation/mask_rcnn_R_50_FPN_3x.yaml" model architecture.

**Configuration & Results:**

* `MODEL.ROI_HEADS.NUM_CLASSES` set to 1 for balloons.
* Hyperparameters fine-tuned for improved accuracy (details in `config.yaml`).
* AP: [Insert your score]. MSE: [Insert your score].

**Visualization:**
